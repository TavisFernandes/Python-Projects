# Automation with Python

This project demonstrates how to automate the processing of Excel spreadsheets using Python and the `openpyxl` library. The provided script (`main.py`) can efficiently handle large and multiple spreadsheets, saving hours or even days of manual work.

## Features

- Loads Excel workbooks and processes data in the specified sheet.
- Automatically adjusts prices by applying a correction factor (e.g., 10% discount).
- Writes the corrected prices back to the spreadsheet.
- Generates a bar chart based on the corrected prices for easy visualization.
- Saves the updated workbook, preserving all changes.

## Benefits

Automating spreadsheet tasks like these can drastically reduce the time and effort required to process large datasets. Instead of manually editing thousands of rows, this script performs the calculations and chart generation programmatically, enabling:

- Faster data processing for large or multiple Excel files.
- Consistent and error-free updates to spreadsheet data.
- Quick generation of visual reports through charts.
- Significant time savings, improving productivity and allowing focus on higher-value tasks.

## Practical Applications

- Financial data adjustments and reporting.
- Sales data analysis with automated charting.
- Inventory management updates.
- Any repetitive Excel data processing tasks that would otherwise be time-consuming.

## Usage

1. Place your Excel file(s) in the project directory.
2. Update the filename in `main.py` or modify the script to process multiple files.
3. Run the script to automatically update prices and generate charts.

This automation approach can be extended and customized to fit various spreadsheet processing needs, making it a powerful tool for anyone working extensively with Excel data.
